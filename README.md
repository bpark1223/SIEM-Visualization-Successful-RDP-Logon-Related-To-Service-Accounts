<h1> SIEM-Visualization-Successful-RDP-Logon-Related-To-Service-Accounts <h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
In this project, I will create a SIEM visualization that monitors successful RDP logons related to service accounts. Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is a Microsoft-developed protocol that allows users to remotely access another computer's desktop environment over a network connection. Service accounts have high privileges, and their credentials are usually never used for RDP logons; therefore, it is important to monitor how they are used.
